Created a program in c++ that takes in a square matrix and will reduce it into Reduced Row-Echelon Form(RREF) for you.


I created every function by scratch using vectors to keep track of the matrix values.

The functions consist of matrice row operations and the recursive algorithm I'm using to reduce into RREF.

This was a fun little thing project I've been working on during the weekends and I finished the program as it can handle every test case now.
